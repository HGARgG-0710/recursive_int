1. Create an infinite-stack implementation...; 
2. Documentation [be thorough...];
3. Add more operations;
4. Add function for printing out the numbers; 
	? Use the same recursive types to define strings [as a recursive 'char *']? 
5. Do a mighty correctness check (in regard to allocations);
6. Re-implement: 

	In such a fashion, so as not to have to call the 'optimize' all the time; 
	This causes a great performance bottleneck [particularly in 'greater' - in some cases, it can cause a 2 times speed decrease]; 

	Possibly, add more methods that are designed speicifally for the optimized recursive_ints?
7. Write a disclaimer that this is a work in progress, when making public; 

	Make distinction between the 'optimized' and 'unoptimized' pieces of API clearer;
