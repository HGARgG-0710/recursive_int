1. Add more operations;
	2.1. Modulo; 
	2.2. Whole division;
2. Run tests (fix bugs)
3. OPTIMIZE:

	Currently, loops that resolve the recursion are all done in terms of the individual increments/decrements 
		(when it comes to arithmetic binary operations, + and * in particular...); 
	This causes large enough arithmetic to grind to a halt. 
	To fix, take out ('abs'-wise) THE SMALLEST IN 'ABS' OF THE TWO VALUES ON CURRENT LEVELS!
		THEN, JUST GO FORWARD AS PREVIOUSLY!

	See if that's a problem anywhere else in the library...; 

4. (precaution) Make tests slightly more thorough...;
