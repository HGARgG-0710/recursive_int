1. Documentation [be thorough...];
2. Add more operations;
	2.1. Modulo; 
	2.2. Whole division;
3. Add function for printing out the numbers; 
	? Use the same recursive types to define strings [as a recursive 'char *']? 
4. Do a mighty correctness check (in regard to allocations);
5. Re-implement: 

	1. OPTIMIZED!
		In such a fashion, so as not to have to call the 'optimize' all the time; 
		This causes a great performance bottleneck [particularly in 'greater' - in some cases, it can cause a 2 times speed decrease]; 

		Possibly, add more methods that are designed speicifally for the optimized recursive_ints?
	2. CALLSTACK! 
		Fix constant usage of recursion; 
		Instead, replace with 'while' loops + pointers; 
6. Write a disclaimer that this is a work in progress, when making public; 

	Make distinction between the 'optimized' and 'unoptimized' pieces of API clearer; 

7. Write tests; 
8. ESSENTIAL: check the names - C has a funnily small limitation on them distinction-wise...;
