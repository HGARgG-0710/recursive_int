1. Add more operations;
	2.1. Modulo; 
	2.2. Whole division;
2. OPTIMIZE:

	Currently, loops that resolve the recursion are all done in terms of the individual increments/decrements 
		(when it comes to arithmetic binary operations, + and * in particular...); 
	This causes large enough arithmetic to grind to a halt. 
	To fix, take out ('abs'-wise) THE SMALLEST IN 'ABS' OF THE TWO VALUES ON CURRENT LEVELS!
		THEN, JUST GO FORWARD AS PREVIOUSLY!

	See if that's a problem anywhere else in the library...; 

3. (precaution) Make tests slightly more thorough...; 
4. NOTE: memory leaks! 

	The code may (probably does) have them. 
	The 'need' for their introdocution was the fact that C code fails upon freeing. 
	Find out why precisely that was and fix.

	For now - keep as-is...;

	[idea: try the 'always make NULL on free-ing thing'];
