1. Documentation [be thorough...];
2. Add more operations;
	2.1. Modulo; 
	2.2. Whole division;
3. Add function for printing out the numbers; 
	? Use the same recursive types to define strings [as a recursive 'char *']? 
4. Do a mighty correctness check (in regard to allocations);
5. Write a disclaimer that this is a work in progress, when making public; 

	Make distinction between the 'optimized' and 'unoptimized' pieces of API clearer; 

6. Write tests; 
7. ESSENTIAL: check the names - C has a funnily small limitation on them distinction-wise...;
