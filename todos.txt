1. Add more operations;
	1.1. Modulo; 
	1.2. Whole division;
2. More symbolic operations:

	They cause algorithms to become from O(n) to O(logn);
	Causes a great speedup to rewrite any actual recursive_int operations in terms of symbolic operations; 

	Think about it (namely, the cost of convertion from one to another and back again...);

3. (just a precaution) For future, ake tests slightly more thorough...; 
4. NOTE: memory leaks! 

	The code may (probably does) have them. 
	The 'need' for their introdocution was the fact that C code fails upon freeing. 
	Find out why precisely that was and fix.

	For now - keep as-is...;

	[idea: try the 'always make NULL on free-ing thing'];

	ALSO - the main issue is difficulty keeping track of values for pointers. 
	To remedy, follow the principle of 'copy, not replace' - instead of replacing already existing values 
		by means of freeing, then returning the new pointer value, just create a copy and free on the level higher. 
	Cleaner for implementations (they no longer require for the given pointer to actually point to dynamically allocated memory).
